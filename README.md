# Dynamic-Traffic-Management-System-using-Iot-and-Machine-Learning-Techniques
  This repository contains the complete implementation of a Dynamic Traffic Management System designed to address urban traffic congestion using cutting-edge technologies. The project integrates machine learning YOLO, IoT, and video analytics to dynamically optimize traffic signal timings based on real-time data.

# Features:
1] Real-Time Traffic Optimization: Utilizes live video feeds to detect and count vehicles and pedestrians without physical sensors.

2] Adaptive Signal Control: Dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on traffic density and pedestrian flow.

3] Machine Learning Predictions: Employs models like  YOLO for accurate vehicle and pedestrian detection.

4] Comprehensive Vehicle Detection: Identifies and counts  vehicles to provide detailed traffic insights.

# Components:
1] IoT Integration: Enhances traffic control with connectivity for managing signal rows and junctions.

2] Video-Based Analysis: Uses advanced object detection models for high-accuracy results.

3] Scalable Architecture: Supports large-scale traffic environments with adaptive, modular design.
